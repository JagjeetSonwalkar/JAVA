/*
Multitasking is a concept where we design such a application which will perform multiple task at the same time .

There are 2 ways to achieve the concept of multitasking :
Process based multitasking  (Multi_processing) 
Thread based multitasking   (Multi_Threading)

process is a running instance of a program

For every process a seprate memory gets allocate by OS , that memory is known as address_space of the process

Thread is light_weight part of process

In case of multi threading to create the multipal tasks we have to create Multithreads

There are 2 ways in which we can create a thread in java
By extending the thread class
by implementing the runnable interface
